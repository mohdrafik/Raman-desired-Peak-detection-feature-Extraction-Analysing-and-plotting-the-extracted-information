# MATLAB_PROJECTS: MATLAB code for feature Extraction,Anlysing and plotting the extracted information
Matlab_projects : MATLAB code for feature Extraction,Anlysing and plotting the extracted information:
 this is related to the select particular desirable peaks from the multiple peaks from data (RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY).
 After selecting the desired peaks, fit them using the inbuilt function "lorentzfit.m" just give here your x and y data by the default it will fit it.
 and return the peak amplitude and corresponding x value at peak and FWHM and constant (c - like base offset) in the parameter "PARAM = [P1 P2 P3 C]".
 Then I wrote the code for fitting, plot and mark the peak and fwhm and create the file where we can write our required important parameters.
 for further processing and comparison with other Raman spectroscopy peaks at the same x position at different voltage. 
 Finally All Parameters extracted and analysed from the given data and plotted using this MATLAB code. 
 This is a complete code for feature extracting,anlysing and plotting the information.
