# MATLAB_PROJECTS: MATLAB code for feature Extraction,Anlysing and plotting the extracted information
Matlab_projects : MATLAB code for feature Extraction,Analyzing and plotting the extracted information:
 This Matlab program selects the desired peaks from the multiple peaks data (RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY)files.
 After selecting the desired peaks,fit them using the lorentz function (lorentzfit.m).
 you need to give x and y valuse data and then it will fit it by lorentz fit function.
 and return the peak amplitude and corresponding x value at peak and FWHM and constant (c - like base offset) in the parameter "PARAM = [P1 P2 P3 C]".
 Then I wrote the code for fitting, plot and mark the peak and fwhm and create the file where we can write our required important parameters.
 for further processing and comparison with other Raman spectroscopy peaks at the same x position at different voltage. 
 Finally All Parameters extracted and analysed from the given data and plotted using this MATLAB code. 
 This is a complete code for feature extracting,anlysing and plotting the information.
